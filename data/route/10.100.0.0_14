remarks:            Manual ROA to allow the ChaosVPN interconnect to
                    announce routes. ChaosVPN uses Tinc which supports
                    only one gateway to DN42, so there must only be one
                    origin ASN listed here.
                    Do not change without mailing list consensus.
