remarks:            This AS is used for the new infrastructure and will completely replace AS4242420117 and AS4242420118 in the near future.
remarks:            
remarks:            This AS is open for new peerings provided that the following requirements are met:
remarks:            - At least two IPv6 BGP sessions are required, IPv4 BGP sessions are optional. Multiprotocol sessions are also possible.
remarks:            - The contact informations in the registry must always be up to date. The tech-c and admin-c must respond within one week and must read the mailing list.
remarks:            - The routing policy must be properly documented in the registry within one week after the peering is established.
remarks:            - The peer AS must have at least one other transit and/or upstream peer.
remarks:            - The peering must not be down for longer periods of time. Foreseeable downtime of more than one day should be coordinated.
remarks:            - The round trip time between the border routers must be reasonable. This is not required for simple downstreams.
remarks:            - Issues in the peer AS can result in the peering being disabled. If this is the case, the peer has to request the reactivation of the peering after all issues are resolved.
remarks:            Please contact the admin-c for peering requests and the tech-c for technical issues.
